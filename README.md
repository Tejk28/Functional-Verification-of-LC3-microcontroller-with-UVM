Author: Tejashree Kulkarni

University: North Carolina State University;  Professor: Bob Oden

Course: ECE 748; Advance Verification with UVM;  Duration: Aug 2023- December2023 

The technology used:  UVM methodologies, SVA, SVTB, CRV testing, Layered testbench Arch, OOPs

Project Accomplishment:

- Tested L3C decode block design using reusable UVM testbench agents of environment, monitor, driver BFM  
- Generated testbench code for other stages using UVMF libraries and integrated all 5 stages of the LC3 microcontroller. 
- Developed a functional coverage model involving CRV and directed
